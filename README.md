# Real
Reimplementing Algorithms.

## What is this repo
The goal of this repo is quite simple. I want to reimplement algorithms that I find particularly interesting. The reason for this is that I want to understand the nitty gritty of how they work and to get myself familiar with state of the art tools and implementations.

## What is this repo not
The goal of this repository is *not* to reimplement algorithms from papers *exactly* and reproduce their results. Rather, I aim to reimplement the general spirit of the algorithms and experiment with these techniques. Experiments that I run in this repo are mostly to verify the implementations and to give me some working experience with them.
